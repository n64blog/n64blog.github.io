Space Station Silicon Valley's odd premise may have you scratching your head, but it's fair to say that it's one of the most unique and entertaining games on the N64.

In this 3D-platforming game, you play as Evo: a robot that's reduced to nothing more than a crawling microchip after a spaceship crash. Luckily, Evo has landed right in the middle of a futuristic zoo full of robotic animals. You must take control of these creatures -- each with their own abilities and attributes -- to navigate various environments, solve puzzles and, above all, keep Evo alive.

The robotic animals you can control look familiar to those found in the real world but often possess fantastic abilities, such as a fox with wheels.

Space Station Silicon Valley received critical praise from reviewers at the time of its release but sold poorly. As a result, it didn't receive any sequels, although an adapted version of the game was released for Nintendo's Game Boy Color in 1999. The game was ported to the Sony PlayStation in 2000 under the name Evo's Space Adventures; this version was considered to be massively inferior.
