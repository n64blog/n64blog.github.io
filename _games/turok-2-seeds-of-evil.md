Building on the success of its first N64 game, Acclaim Entertainment went all out with Turok 2: Seeds of Evil, making one of the most technically impressive third-party games on the N64 in the process.

Turok 2: Seeds of Evil released in a very different gaming landscape to its predecessor, [**Turok: Dinosaur Hunter**](/games/turok-dinosaur-hunter.html), despite that game having released only a year earlier. Rare had taken the industry by storm with its revolutionary first-person shooter [**GoldenEye 007**](/games/goldeneye-007.html) (on a home console no less), setting a considerably high new standard for the genre.

It’s clear that this heavily influenced Turok 2: Seeds of Evil’s development, and the game borrows a number of features from its James Bond rival, such as objective-based gameplay and multiplayer versus modes for up to four players.

Turok 2: Seeds of Evil is far from an imitation, however, and actually one-ups GoldenEye 007 in a number of ways. In particular, the game’s graphics were remarkable for the time, featuring highly detailed, large environments and impressive character movement and hitbox animations. It was one of the first N64 games to use the N64 Expansion Pak for higher resolution graphics (the Expansion Pak was originally intended to be only be used with the 64DD add-on). While the high-res mode doubles the game’s resolution and enhances its detail greatly, it does come at the cost of the frame rate. In fact, even without the Expansion Pak, Turok 2: Seeds of Evil is often quite choppy in terms of performance.

The game also offers the player a wide range of graphically violent weapons to use, most notably the Cerebral Bore -- a gun that fires a probe that drills through the victim’s skull and sucks out its brain. In case you were wondering, this game is not for kids.

The game released in 1998 to very positive reviews and sold around 1.4 million copies worldwide. It received a sequel, Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion, in 2000. The game was remastered by Nightdive Studios and re-released on PC in 2017. This updated version includes enhanced visuals and some minor gameplay tweaks.
