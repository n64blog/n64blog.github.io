Mario and friends return for yet another run round the board in search of stars.

Mario Party 3 was the last game in the series to be released on the N64, and was also the last first-party release for the system.

This iteration is notably quite different from the previous two games. The roster of playable characters includes Waluigi and Daisy for the first time. Also, this game has a different graphical style to its predecessors, sporting visuals that make it look like a pop-up book. For the first time in the series, Mario Party 3 introduces a single-player story mode.

Otherwise, the core gameplay is largely same, and there are 71 mini-games, all of which are unique to this title.
