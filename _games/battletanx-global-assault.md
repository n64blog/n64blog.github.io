Save the world by blowing it up using a wide range of tanks.

This sequel to 1998's BattleTanx adopts a more global theme and gives you the opportunity to battle it out across North America and Europe and destroy important landmarks along the way. The game features a campaign mode that be played with up to two players, as well as a number of four-player deathmatch modes.
