Your late grandfather has left his farm to you. Now, it’s up to you to get it back up and running, and take on his responsibilities to the local village.

Harvest Moon 64 is the third game in Natsume’s long-running Story of Seasons series. It was only released in Japan and North America: a PAL localisation was initially planned but later cancelled. However, it was eventually released in PAL regions through the Wii U’s eShop to celebrate the series’ 20th anniversary.

In the game you are given a small farm and some tools with which to restore it to a crop-producing estate. There are a number of other activities in which you can partake, including raising livestock, training horses, entering festivals and even courting and marrying a local lady (sadly, the game only allows you to play as a male character).

Upon release, Harvest Moon 64 received a warm reception, although criticism was levelled at its repetitive music and glitchy visuals.
