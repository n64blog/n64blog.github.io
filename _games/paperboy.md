Atari’s arcade hit makes the transition to the third dimension in this quirky N64 remake.

Much like it had done with [**Gauntlet Legends**](/games/gauntlet-legends.html) and **Rampage: World Tour**, Paperboy was yet another attempt by Midway Games to cash in on gamers’ nostalgia for classic arcade games of the 1980s.

In terms of gameplay, Paperboy is very similar to the original game, but sports 3D visuals and, to some extent, gives you a bit more freedom of movement. As the new paperboy for The Daily Sun, it’s up to you to deliver newspapers to all paying customers while avoiding dangerous obstacles. You can also score extra bonus points by lobbing papers at bystanders, objects and even non-paying customers’ houses.

The game features a variety of different environments, such as a typically suburban street, a trailer park and even a national park. Another notable improvement is that you can choose to play as as a papergirl in this version.
