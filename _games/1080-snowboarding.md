When it came to developing 1080 Snowboarding, Nintendo approached it in a way similar to its earlier N64 racing game, Wave Race 64.

The game delivers a realistic snowboarding experience, although not at the expense of fun. There are multiple game modes with each one either focusing on straightforward racing against an AI opponent or performing tricks to accrue points.
