Following the massive success of its Donkey Kong Country series for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, it only made sense that Rare bring DK and friends to the N64.

Donkey Kong 64 was advertised around the time of its 1999 release as being so big it needed the N64 Expansion Pak. It's now known that the real reason for this requirement was in fact because of a game-breaking bug. This resulted in Nintendo having to bundled the Expansion Pak with copies of the game at considerable expense (although this benefitted later Expansion Pak-only games Perfect Dark and The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask).

Nevertheless, Donkey Kong 64 is still a massive game and much like with many of Rare's other games, there's a heavy emphasis on collecting things.

In this game you get to play as five different characters across eight worlds (as well as a hub world that connects it all together). A lot of backtracking is required as you can acess new areas in earlier worlds through unlocking characters and additional abilities,

In addition to a hefty single-player story mode, there are multiplayer battle modes which can be played with up to four people.
