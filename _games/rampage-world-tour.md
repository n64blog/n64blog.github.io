Ported from the arcade to the N64 in 1998, Rampage World Tour gave players the chance to smash up buildings and devour innocent bystanders.

Midway Games acquired the rights to a number of Atari Games’ IPs in 1996, resulting in a number of arcade games, including Rampage: World Tour, making the transition to home consoles.

Rampage World Tour is a 2D side-scrolling action game in which players take control of one of three giant mutant creatures. The goal is to do as much damage as possible to the world’s major cities, while eating a good deal of the population along the way. It’s no walk in the park, however, as Earth’s military forces are doing their best to stop you.

The game is a faithful port, and although you no longer need to pay per play, you’ll nevertheless find yourself hitting the continue button a lot. It is notable for being one of the few N64 games that support up to maximum of three players.

A sequel, **Rampage 2: Universal Tour**, was released for the N64 in 1999.
