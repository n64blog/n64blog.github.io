The N64 earned a reputation from some critics back in the day for its over-reliance on cute 3D platforming games.

So it came as something of a surprise when Rare approached Conker's Bad Fur Day by chucking out the tired kiddy trope and masterfully transformed it into an adventure stuffed to the brim with vulgarity, and scatological and downright offensive humour.

Originally known as Conker's Quest (and later temporarily renamed to Twelve Tales: Conker 64), the game was transformed mid-development after early feedback claimed it was unoriginal and too similar to Rare's earlier 3D platforming game Banjo-Kazooie.

The game underwent a radical transformation, taking on a mature adult theme with the protagonist, Conker the Squirrel, now being a greedy, self-centred binge-drinker.

Conker's adventure is anything but heroic too; he's just trying to get home after a heavy night down the local pub. What follows is a hilarious action-platforming quest filled with pop-culture parodies and crude humour.

Conker's Bad Fur Day is one of the most technically advanced game on the N64, featuring high-quality textures and character animations, as well as full voiceover for all characters. As a result, the game was released on a 64MB cartridge, the largest produced by Nintendo.

In addition to the single-player story mode, Conker's Bad Fur Day has numerous multiplayer modes for up to four players (with support for AI-controlled bots in many instances too).
