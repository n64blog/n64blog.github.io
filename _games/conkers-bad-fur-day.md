The N64 earned a reputation from some critics back in the day for its over-reliance on cute 3D platforming games.

So it came as something of a surprise when Rare approached Conker's Bad Fur Day by chucking out the tired kiddy trope and instead producing an adventure stuffed to the brim with vulgarity, foul language and a hefty amount of scatological humour.

Originally known as Conker's Quest (and later temporarily renamed to Twelve Tales: Conker 64), the game underwent a transformation mid-development after early feedback claimed it was unoriginal and too similar to Rare's earlier 3D platforming game Banjo-Kazooie. As a result, the game took on a mature adult theme with the protagonist, Conker the Squirrel, now being a greedy, self-centred binge-drinker.

Conker's adventure is anything but heroic too; he's just trying to get home after a heavy night down the local pub. What follows is a hilarious action-platforming quest filled with pop-culture parodies and crude humour.

Conker's Bad Fur Day is one of the most technically advanced game on the N64, featuring high-quality textures and character animations, as well as a full voice track for all characters. Because of this, the game was released on a 64MB cartridge -- the largest produced by Nintendo.

In addition to the single-player story mode, Conker's Bad Fur Day has numerous multiplayer modes for up to four players (with support for AI-controlled bots in many instances too).
