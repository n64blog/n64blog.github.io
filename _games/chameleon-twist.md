A curious chameleon follows a rabbit down a magical hole, becoming anthropomorphised in the process. They must now use their elongated tongue in elaborate ways to traverse through six magical lands in a bid to get back home again.

Chameleon Twist falls under the 3D platformer category, but features unusual gameplay mechanics made possible by the game’s lizard cast. By using the N64’s analog joystick, you can extend your character’s tongue to collect otherwise unreachable objects, to swallow enemies, and, in lieu of jumping, to pull your chameleon across to platforms. There’s also a multiplayer battle mode for up to four players.

There are noticeable differences between the Japanese and international versions of the game. In the Japanese version, many levels feature drastically different layouts, and you can play the game’s multiplayer mode against AI opponents. Most noticeably, the Japanese version has an actual ending cutscene; the international versions omit this and go straight to the game’s credits.

The game received a sequel, Chameleon Twist 2, in 1999, which was also released for the N64.
