EA was quick to acquire the James Bond licence after it saw the immense success Rare had with GoldenEye 007.

The first game EA developed was based on the film Tomorrow Never Dies, which was released exclusively for the Sony PlayStation. As a third-person shooter, it was quite a departure from GoldenEye 007 (and nowhere near as impressive in terms of gameplay and design), resulting in it being unable to live up to critics and players' expectations.

With The World Is Not Enough, EA recruited developer Eurocom to make a game that was similar in design to Rare's hit game. Based on the 19th James Bond film of the same name, the game is a first-person shooter that also tasks players with completing mission objectives.

There are 14 single-player missions and a multiplayer mode which include the option to play against AI-controlled bots.
