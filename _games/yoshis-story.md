Pitched as a sequel to the critically acclaimed Super Mario World 2: Yoshi’s Island, Yoshi’s Story didn’t deliver the same magic, but nevertheless gave N64 owners a charming 2D platforming experience.

In this game, the Yoshis must traverse a number of levels, collecting fruit along the way to fill each level’s Fruit Frame. Similarly to its SNES prequel, you’ll need to explore the levels in great depth to discover all the fruit you require.

Yoshi’s Story sports vibrant and colourful pre-rendered 3D visuals, but the gameplay is strictly 2D. There are 24 levels, many of which are short in length, making this a relatively short game -- something which critics took issue with at the time of the game’s release.

During development, Yoshi’s Story was known as Yoshi’s Island 64. There are some slight differences between the Japanese and North American and PAL versions of the game, most notably the option to be able save and continue your progress through the game’s story mode.
