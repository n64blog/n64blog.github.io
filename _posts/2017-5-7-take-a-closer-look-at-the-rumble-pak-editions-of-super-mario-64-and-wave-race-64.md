Following the success of Star Fox 64 and the N64 Rumble Pak, Nintendo released revised versions of Super Mario 64 and Wave Race 64 to further showcase its force-feedback accessory.

Known as Super Mario 64 Shindō Pak Taiō Version and Wave Race 64 Shindō Pak Taiō Version, these enhanced editions were only released in Japan in July 1997.

In addition to Rumble Pak support, there are also a few other minor differences between these re-issues and the original versions.

## How is the Rumble Pak used in the Shindō Pak Taiō Versions? ##

It's worth noting that the gameplay in both games is virtually identical to their respective original versions; nothing has been adapted or altered because of the Rumble Pak support.

### Super Mario 64 ###

As you might expect, the Rumble Pak vibrates both when hitting enemies and getting hit by them. Certain moves, such as the ground pound and forward dive, will also cause provide feedback. Playing with Mario’s face on the title screen also results in a hefty jolt when stretching and letting go of the portly plumber’s elastic facial features.

However, some of the other additions seem a little unnecessary. The Rumble Pak vibrates when you select a game file and pick up a red coin or extra life. It’s almost as if these extra bits were included to constantly remind you that the Rumble Pak is supported.

### Wave Race 64 ###

The Rumble Pak is a perfect fit for Wave Race 64; it really is such a shame that it wasn’t included to begin with.

As you cruise around the course, the Rumble Pak gently hums in sync with your jet-ski’s engine. Hitting a big wave, landing a big jump or crashing all result in sharp burst of feedback. It really adds a lot to the experience, making Wave Race 64’s impressive wave physics feel almost tangible.

## Other differences? ##

Both games include a new animated icon on their title screens highlighting the Rumble Pak support.

### Super Mario 64 ###

- The Shindō Pak Taiō Version is in fact the international release of the game, albeit translated back into Japanese. As a result, it doesn’t feature the [glitches and bugs](https://tcrf.net/Super_Mario_64_(Nintendo_64)/Regional_and_Version_Differences/en#Glitches) present in the original Japanese version.
- It also includes voice clips from the international release, which previously weren’t in the Japanese version.
- The most notable difference is the inclusion of a title screen Easter egg. Pressing the Z-button fills the background with tiles that replicate Mario’s face multiple times.

### Wave Race 64 ###

- In terms of gameplay, the only difference is that you can now race a ghost (portrayed as a dolphin) in Time Trial mode.
- Otherwise, some of the voice samples and a couple of the music tracks have been redone in the Shindō Pak Taiō Version.

## Are these the definitive editions? ##

Both Super Mario 64 Shindō Pak Taiō Version and Wave Race 64 Shindō Pak Taiō Version feature everything the original games had (save for some subtle changes) and more, so you could say these are indeed the definitive editions.

At the same time, they’re also only available in Japanese. They’re both relatively light in terms of text, but, for example, knowing which Star mission you’re doing in Super Mario 64 will most likely depend on your memory of the game (unless you’ve not played it before).

## How much are the Shindō Pak Taiō Versions worth? ##

At the time of writing, both games are still relatively easy to get hold of, so don’t expect to pay a great deal for them. In fact, you may find that you can get hold of these versions cheaper than the NTSC or PAL versions.
