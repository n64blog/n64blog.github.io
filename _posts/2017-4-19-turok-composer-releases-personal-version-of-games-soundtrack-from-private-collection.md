After 20 years, Darren Mitchell, the composer of Turok: Dinosaur Hunter, has for the very first time released his personal CD of the game’s soundtrack for purchase.

This version was originally recorded in Darren’s home studio back in 1997 when he was still living in Austin, Texas (and working for Iguana Entertainment). According to a post by Darren on his Facebook page, this album contains music that has never been released before, and was produced using the original equipment he had at the time.

As a result, the album features a far superior sound quality than that of the original game’s soundtrack, and has been personally arranged by Darren as a concept album.

We recently [interviewed Darren to mark Turok: Dinosaur Hunter’s 20th anniversary](/article/2017/03/05/the-beat-of-the-jungle-darren-mitchell-on-composing-the-turok-dinosaur-hunter-soundtrack.html). He gave us an exceptional insight into what composing music during the early days of the N64 was really like.

You can purchase the album from [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/album/id1219061121?ls=1&app=itunes), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Turok-Dinosaur-Hunter-Darren-Mitchell/dp/B06XTJQ57S/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1491475154&sr=8-1&keywords=Darren+Mitchell#customerReviews) or [Bandcamp](https://darrenmitchell.bandcamp.com/album/turok-the-dinosaur-hunter).

Darren also composed the soundtrack to two more Turok games on the N64: the critically acclaimed Turok 2: Seeds of Evil and Turok: Rage Wars. He continues to produce music today and regularly posts updates to his [Facebook page](https://en-gb.facebook.com/Darren-Mitchell-Music-555961567800992/).
