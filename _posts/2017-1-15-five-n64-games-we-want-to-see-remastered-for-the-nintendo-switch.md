This week, Nintendo finally unveiled its next video game system, the Nintendo Switch.

In case you didn’t know, this new system is a home-console and portable-handheld hybrid, meaning you can play your games on the TV at home or take them on the go with you by playing on the system’s built-in screen. It even features two nifty little detachable controllers call Joy-Cons, which can be split between two players for multiplayer.

Online reaction to the system’s unveiling has been mixed; it’s going to launch in March at an eye-watering £279.99 in the UK with a mere five launch games (additional controllers are also stupendously pricey). Sadly, there doesn’t appear to be many releases for it over the course of 2017 either. On the plus side, the next Super Mario game, Super Mario Odyssey, looks like it will adopt the open-environment exploration approach first seen in Super Mario 64.

This got us thinking: wouldn’t it be great if Nintendo announced some remastered Nintendo 64 games for the Switch? We couldn’t help but get carried away thinking about it, so we’ve drawn up a list of five games we’d love to see appear in upgraded form on the system.

Which N64 games would you like to see remastered for the Switch? Let us know on [Twitter](www.twitter.com/n64gamers).

## Wave Race 64

Nintendo’s phenomenal jet-ski racing game did a superb job of highlighting just how powerful the N64 was during its heyday. The game’s wave physics and water animations are impressive even today, but they could look even better on a more modern piece of kit like the Switch.

Wave Race 64 features a two-player split-screen mode -- a perfect fit for the Switch with its detachable controllers. The system also has LAN and online capabilities, so up to four players could race against one another across two or more systems.

The Joy-Con controllers include HD rumble, which is apparently a more precise form of force feedback that can, for example, simulate the feeling of shaking a cup full of ice cubes. Employing this technology to provide the sensation of your jet-ski hitting the waves would make Wave Race 64 an even more immersive experience.

## Pilotwings 64

The Pilotwings series has been left to rust in the hangar for some time now. Although the franchise did re-emerge on the Nintendo 3DS in the form of Pilotwings Resort, it looked more like a Wii Sports game and, as a result, was a much more casual experience.

![Flying the Gyrocopter under a bridge in Pilotwings 64](/assets/post/gyrocoptor-pilotwings-64.jpg)

Pilotwings 64 is by far the most complex game in the series (although thankfully not too much so), not to mention that it had lovely big environments that we’d love to see remastered with modern graphics. Who wouldn’t want to zip across Little States Island in glorious HD?

The Switch’s Joy-Con controllers have motion controls, which could be a nice alternative control method (so long as it’s optional) -- the thought of holding each half of the controller in both your hands and flapping like a bird to operate the Birdman suit is pretty hilarious too. And, of course, the HD rumble could come in very handy for identifying wind strength and direction.

## 1080 Snowboarding

This is another series that really needs to return to our screens, and an N64 remaster for Switch would be an excellent starting place. 1080 Snowboarding was one of the most visually impressive games on the N64; it’s naturally looking a little dated now, but at least the gameplay is still solid. Improving the character models, environment textures and the lighting effects could easily make this a standout game for the Switch in terms of visuals.

There’s also a ton of variety when it comes to 1080 Snowboarding, making it ideal for both home and portable play. Got time with the TV at home? Get stuck into a few races. On the bus on the way to work? A quick burst of Trick Attack will give you a shot of adrenaline before the work day begins.

Then there’s the Joy-Con controllers, which can emulate the sensation of surfing down the snowy slopes through HD rumble and allow for two-player play both at home or on the go.

## F-Zero X

We’re not gonna lie: the main reason F-Zero X is here is because a) it’s the best F-Zero game and b) Nintendo has seemingly given up on the series and needs to release another game, even if it just a remaster.

![Rainbow Road track in F-Zero X for N64.](/assets/post/f-zero-x-n64-rainbow-road.jpg)

As much as we love how fast F-Zero X feels, it’s fair to say that it’s far from the best-looking game on the system. An HD refresh with new vehicle models and improved track visuals could certainly make F-Zero X look and feel like an entirely new game.

Updating the game to include the additional cups, track editor and vehicle creator from the F-Zero X Expansion Kit -- which released exclusively in Japan for the 64DD add-on -- would be a welcome treat for long-time fans of the game in the West.

And then there’s the question of multiplayer. We’d happily settle for split-screen play on a single Switch, as well as online multiplayer (imagine up to 30 cars racing across Mute City like in the Grand Prix mode).

## Goemon’s Great Adventure

We would’ve said that there’s more chance of fitting a whale up your bum than Konami ever releasing another Ganbare Goemon game. But then again, it did announce a brand new Bomberman game for the Switch, so maybe there’s still some hope!

![Tea Room from Goemon's Great Adventure for Nintendo 64.](/assets/post/goemons-great-adventure-n64-tea-room.jpg)

Goemon’s Great Adventure would be a good fit for the Switch: it’s got lots of relatively short, self-contained stages -- ideal for if you’re playing in portable mode while travelling. Also, you’ve got the handy Joy-Con controllers so you can play the game co-operatively with a friend. Sure, the limited number of buttons could prove problematic when it comes to the game’s giant robot battles, but we’re sure the inputs for the more complex moves could be remapped.

## What are your thoughts?

If the Nintendo Switch isn’t your thing, then good news: all these games are already available on the good ol’ N64. Sure, it’s not portable, but it also doesn’t cost £279.99 (not to mention you'll probably only get 2.5 hours before the Switch's battery runs out).
