**May the Force be with you -- because you’re gonna need it to have any hope of beating many of Star Wars: Rogue Squadron’s tougher missions.**

Overall, Rogue Squadron is not an especially difficult game, nor is it even renowned for being one of the N64’s hardest games. At the same time though, there are moments during this adventure where you’ll realise just how damn lucky the Rebel Alliance was to survive against the Galactic Empire, let alone defeat it.

We’ve compiled a list of what we feel are the game’s toughest missions. Have you managed to get gold medals on all of these? If so, [tweet us](www.twitter.com/n64gamers) a picture or two (as proof) and we’ll brag about your extremely high midichlorian count to the rest of the world!

## Prisons of Kessel

You and the rest of Rogue Squadron are helping Crix Madine (in a Lambda-class shuttle) to infiltrate the Imperial prison complex on Kessel so he can rescue Rebel prisoners. Sounds simple enough, right?

What makes this mission so tricky is that you have to deal with threats from everywhere. One minute you’re taking out turbolaser turrets and AT-STs, the next you’re desperately trying to fend off TIE fighters as they perform deadly diving runs on the shuttle.

And even after you’ve rescued everyone from the prison, you still have to ensure the shuttle can escape the planet -- not so easy when even more TIE fighters arrive to pursue it.

## Moff Seerdon’s Revenge

It makes sense that the final mission in the game’s storyline would be difficult. Much like with the Prisons of Kessel, this mission requires you to battle both air and ground units, but instead of protecting a single shuttle, you’re trying to prevent the destruction of buildings all over the map.

![X-wing locks on to enemy TIE fighters in Moff Seerdon's Revenge mission in Star Wars: Rogue Squadron for N64.](/assets/post/star-wars-rogue-squadron-n64-x-wing-seeker-torpedoes.jpg)

Some of the enemy TIE interceptors in this mission have clearly been programmed to relentlessly target you, to the point where trying to take one of them head-on is tantamount to suicide.

Once and, more importantly, _if_ you survive this, Moff Seerdon shows up in a shuttle for a final showdown. Given that you’ve had to protect similar-looking shuttles, it should be mostly harmless, right?

![X-wing fighter shot down over Thyferra in Star Wars: Rogue Squadron for N64.](/assets/post/star-wars-rogue-squadron-n64-x-wing-shot-down.jpg)

Wrong! This thing is equipped with more weapons than a Star Destroyer. Make sure you save up as many missiles and lives as you can, because you’re sure as hell going to need them if you want to stand a chance against this monstrosity.

## The Battle of Calamari

![V-wing fighter in Star Wars: Rogue Squadron for N64.](/assets/post/star-wars-rogue-squadron-n64-v-wing.jpg)

Set six years after Return of the Jedi, this bonus mission does not involve deep-fried squid (sadly), but rather massive, incredibly tough vehicles known as World Devastators, which are ravaging the planet of Calamari (Admiral Ackbar’s homeworld).

![World devastator from Star Wars: Rogue Squadron for N64.](/assets/post/star-wars-rogue-squadron-n64-world-devastator.jpg)

For this mission, you’re given a brand new fighter, the V-wing. It comes with rapid-fire dual laser cannons, homing cluster missiles and the ability to boost at considerable speed for a short period of time. Once you’re in this thing, you’ll feel just like Dack when he said he could take on the whole Empire by himself.

![Battle of Calamari in Rogue Squadron N64](/assets/post/star-wars-rogue-squadron-n64-battle-of-calamari.jpg)

But as we all know: Dack bought it. Remember that nice new ship of yours? The first thing you see in this mission is one of them getting shot down. That's because World Devastators possess an absurd number of homing-missile and turbolaser cannons, all of which are situated right next to the shield generator you’ll need to blow up before you can do any real damage. On top of this, there’s a complement of droid TIE fighters, which manoeuvre like nothing else you’ve seen in the past 15 missions. That fancy new ship of yours now has more holes in it than Swiss cheese.

It’s just as well that the events of this mission are now no longer canon.

## Escape from Fest

![AT-PTs running from pursuing AT-AT in Star Wars: Rogue Squadron](/assets/post/star-wars-rogue-squadron-n64-escape-from-fest-at-pts.jpg)

Rebel agents have infiltrated an Imperial weapons facility on the icy planet of Fest and have captured a few AT-PT walkers, a new type of experimental vehicle created by the Empire. However, you’ve already seen these AT-PTs in previous missions, and you already know that they are, in fact, pretty shit. Out of all the vehicles these agents could have taken -- such as the massive, near-indestructible AT-ATs -- the Rebels decide to take the puniest, most ineffective thing they could find.

![Tripping up an AT-AT with a tow cable in Star Wars: Rogue Squadron](/assets/post/star-wars-rogue-squadron-n64-fest-snowspeeder-tow-cable-at-at.jpg)

Hell has quite literally frozen over on Fest, as what ensues is one of the most difficult and frustrating moments you’ll find in an N64 game. You have to protect these pathetic walkers from AT-ATs (which have the firepower to destroy the AT-PTs in a few hits), tanks, gun turrets and even TIE Bombers. The fact that the AT-PT drivers decide to travel through one of the most exposed areas on the planet also doesn’t help.

![Snowspeeder targets the shield generator on Fest in Star Wars: Rogue Squadron for N64.](/assets/post/star-wars-rogue-squadron-n64-escape-from-fest-shield-generator.jpg)

Keeping all of the AT-PTs alive is an almost insurmountable task, and one that requires you to destroy everything in a specific order as quickly as you can. You can do everything right and still miss that one TIE Bomber 10 seconds before the end, resulting in you having to do the whole mission all over again.

**Force mastery required:** Darth Vader

## Raid on Sullust

![Shield-protected Imperial station on Sullust in Star Wars: Rogue Squadron](/assets/post/star-wars-rogue-squadron-n64-sullust-space-station.jpg)

In this mission, you and your Rebel wingmates are tasked with destroying a floating Imperial base situated within a volcano. Despite the fact that this installation is already more than well protected by its environment, the Empire has also surrounded it with a complex network of shield generators, TIE fighters, AT-STs, turbolaser turrets and more homing-missile launchers than a garrison Imperial Stormtroopers.

![Y-wing commences a bombing run on shield generator in Raid on Sullust.](/assets/post/star-wars-rogue-squadron-n64-raid-on-sullust.jpg)

You’re given a Y-wing for this mission, a ship that Luke Skywalker often refers to throughout the game as being one that can take a beating. In Raid of Sullust, this simply isn’t true. You will be lucky if your Y-wing lasts longer than 30 seconds against the onslaught of homing missiles the game throws at you. The audio alert your Y-wing makes when a missile is locked on to you plays relentlessly for the majority of this mission. Thankfully, you don’t usually have to hear it for too long because you will be spending most of your time looking at the Game Over screen when attempting this mission.

![Y-wing gunned down by missile launchers in Raid on Sullust](/assets/post/star-wars-rogue-squadron-n64-missile-launchers-raid-on-sullust.jpg)

If the Empire had protected the Death Star with the defences it has on Sullust, then there quite simply wouldn’t have been an Empire Strikes Back.
