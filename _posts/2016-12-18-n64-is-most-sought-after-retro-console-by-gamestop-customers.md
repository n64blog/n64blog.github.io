Gaming retailer, GameStop, recently conducted a survey of its loyalty programme members, asking them which retro consoles they’re most interested in. Understandably, Nintendo systems ranked highly, but the one that came out above all the rest in first position -- quite surprisingly -- was the N64.

Since October, GameStop has started to sell and accept trade-ins of retro gaming products at its North American stores. Given the ever-increasing prices of retro games on eBay due to demand and the recent sales success of the Mini NES Classic Edition system, it’s easy to see why GameStop has embraced retro in the way it has.

The top 10 consoles that GameStop’s loyalty programme members are interested in is as follows:

1. Nintendo 64
1. Nintendo Entertainment System
1. Super Nintendo Entertainment System
1. Sony PlayStation
1. Sega Genesis
1. Xbox
1. Sega Dreamcast
1. Sega Saturn
1. Game Boy
1. Game Boy Advance

Nostalgia is certainly an important factor, but there are a number of other reasons that could explain why the N64 remains so popular with gamers. For example, the system only has 388 games in its library -- including industry-changing games such as Super Mario 64 and The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time --  which makes collecting appealing because obtaining a full collection can seem a lot more achievable. N64 emulation is also far from perfect, and Nintendo has only re-released a small selection of N64 games through its digital eShop channels, meaning that the only way to play a lot of games is in their original cartridge form.

It’s unknown if this survey will in any way influence the amount of N64 products GameStop will stock in its stores.
