Created by N64 ROM hacker "zoinkity" and translator "mikeryan", the patch translates all HUD and menu elements into English. What's truly impressive, however, is that English-language support for the North American version of the Nintendo 64 Voice Recognition Unit has also been added.

The patch first appeared on the Shooters Forever forum and ROMhacking.net on 1 April 2017 -- thankfully, it wasn't an April Fool's Day prank. You can use this patched version with a PC-based N64 emulator or on a flashcart device such as the [EverDrive 64](http://n64blog.com/article/2017/01/29/everdrive-64-guide-what-is-it-and-should-you-buy-one.html).

YouTuber ShiryuGL has uploaded the following video showing English gameplay:

## Known bug/error ##

It's important to note that there's currently an issue that may affect some EverDrive 64 users. The game's title screen is meant to appear after the opening cinematic,  but some users are met with a black screen. It may be possible to get past this screen if you can still hear sound. If you can't hear anything then chances are you won't be able to get to the mode select screen.

While zoinkity is currently in the process of identifying the problem, a cursory evaluation would suggest that EverDrive 64 V3 users aren't able to play the ROM at all (which means we've sadly not had the chance to play it yet). We'll update this post once we know more.

## What is Densha de Go! 64? ##

While relatively unknown in the West due to being a Japanese exclusive, Densha de Go! 64 is part of a long-running line of train simulation games developed by Taito. It uses a bespoke peripheral, the Densha de Go! 64 controller, which resembles a real-life train control system (albeit simplified).

The game, which we recently featured in our offbeat article, [N64 games that are like second jobs](http://n64blog.com/article/2017/04/02/n64-games-that-are-like-second-jobs.html), is remarkably difficult.

## How do I get the patch? ##

You can download the patch from the [Densha de Go! 64 translation page](http://www.romhacking.net/translations/2947/) on ROMhacking.net. You will need a ROM of the game and an xdelta patcher to apply the patch. The download includes a README file containing instructions for the localised VRU voice commands.
