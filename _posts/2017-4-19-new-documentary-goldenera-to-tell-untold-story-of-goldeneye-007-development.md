Rollercoaster Films, the company behind GoldenEra, has launched an Indiegogo campaign to crowdfund the documentary, offering a selection of GoldenEye 007-themed rewards for backers.

According to the project’s Indiegogo page, the documentary will look at how the game’s relatively inexperienced team managed to create one of the most influential first-person shooters of all time.

Rollercoaster Films has already interviewed some of the game’s development team and members of the gaming press who were active at the time of GoldenEye 007’s release. They are now seeking seeking $85,000 USD to increase the overall scope and quality of the production so that they can tell a more complete story of the game’s creation.

Pledges begin at $5 USD, although you’ll need to donate $25 in order to receive a digital copy of the documentary. While none of the backer perks include any paraphernalia directly related to the game, the $1,500 backer reward nets you a bungee-jumping experience at the Verzasca Dam in Switzerland, which appeared in the film version of GoldenEye 007 and was digitally recreated in the N64 game.

As one of most significant video game releases of all time, GoldenEye 007’s development history has already been covered extensively in the past. It will be interesting to see what new light GoldenEra can shed on its origins.

At the time of writing, the campaign has raised 1% of its target, although there’s still a month to go before it closes.
