Over 200 musicians from around the world have teamed up to produce an incredible compilation of 87 N64 game covers.

A wide range of N64 games are represented on the album. You'll find classic tunes from popular titles such as Super Mario 64 and The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, as well as music from lesser known games such as Buck Bumble and Cruis'n World. It's the ultimate listening experience for any N64 fan!

Better yet, the album is [completely free to download from Bandcamp](https://tributealbum64.bandcamp.com/ "Tribute Album 64").
